# Security Release Process

WarehousePG diskquota has adopted this security disclosure and response policy
to ensure we responsibly handle critical issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability - Private Disclosure Process

Security is of the highest importance and all security vulnerabilities or
suspected security vulnerabilities in WarehousePG diskquota should be reported
to the WarehousePG project team privately, to minimize attacks against current
users of WarehousePG diskquota before they are fixed. Vulnerabilities will be
investigated and patched in the next patch (or minor) release of WarehousePG
diskquota as soon as possible. This information could be kept entirely
internal to the project.

If you know of a publicly disclosed security vulnerability for WarehousePG
diskquota, please **IMMEDIATELY** contact the WarehousePG project team
(analytics-security@enterprisedb.org).

**IMPORTANT: Do not file public issues on GitHub for security vulnerabilities!**

To report a vulnerability or a security-related issue, please contact the email
address with the details of the vulnerability. The email will be fielded by the
WarehousePG project team. Emails will be addressed promptly, including a
detailed plan to investigate the issue and any potential workarounds to perform
in the meantime. Do not report non-security-impacting bugs through this
channel. Use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/warehouse-pg/whpg-diskquota/issues)
instead.

## Proposed Email Content

Provide a descriptive subject line and in the body of the email include the
following information:

- Basic identity information, such as your name and your affiliation or company.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability (POC scripts, screenshots, and
  logs are all helpful to us).
- Description of the effects of the vulnerability on WarehousePG diskquota and
  the related hardware and software configurations (including the WarehousePG
  version), so that the WarehousePG project team can reproduce it.
- How the vulnerability affects WarehousePG diskquota usage and an estimation
  of the attack surface, if there is one.
- List other projects or dependencies that were used in conjunction with
  WarehousePG diskquota to produce the vulnerability.

## When to report a vulnerability

- When you think WarehousePG diskquota has a potential security vulnerability.
- When you suspect a potential vulnerability but you are unsure whether it
  impacts WarehousePG diskquota or the WarehousePG server. Report it here and
  the WarehousePG project team will route it.
- When you know of or suspect a potential vulnerability on another project that
  is used by WarehousePG diskquota.

## Patch, Release, and Disclosure

The WarehousePG project team will respond to vulnerability reports as
follows:

1. The WarehousePG project team will investigate the vulnerability and determine
   its effects and criticality.
2. If the issue is not deemed to be a vulnerability, the WarehousePG project team
   will follow up with a detailed reason for rejection.
3. The WarehousePG project team will initiate a conversation with the reporter
   promptly.
4. If a vulnerability is acknowledged and the timeline for a fix is determined,
   the WarehousePG project team will work on a plan to communicate with the
   appropriate community, including identifying mitigating steps that affected
   users can take to protect themselves until the fix is rolled out.
5. The WarehousePG project team will also create a
   [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document) using the [CVSS
   Calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0). The WarehousePG
   project team makes the final call on the calculated CVSS; it is better to
   move quickly than making the CVSS perfect. Issues may also be reported to
   [Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org/) using this [scoring
   calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator). The CVE
   will initially be set to private.
6. The WarehousePG project team will work on fixing the vulnerability and perform
   internal testing before preparing to roll out the fix.
7. A public disclosure date is negotiated by the WarehousePG project
   team, and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as
   possible once a user mitigation or patch is available. It is reasonable to
   delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, or the
   solution is not well-tested. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate
   (especially if it's already publicly known) to a few weeks. The WarehousePG
   project team holds the final say when setting a public disclosure date.
8. Once the fix is confirmed, the WarehousePG project team will release it in
   the next patch or minor release of WarehousePG diskquota, and update the
   WarehousePG diskquota packages for the supported WarehousePG releases as
   necessary. Upon release of the patched version of WarehousePG diskquota, we
   will follow the **Public Disclosure Process**.

## Public Disclosure Process

The WarehousePG project team publishes a public advisory to the WarehousePG
community as a
[GitHub security advisory](https://github.com/warehouse-pg/whpg-diskquota/security/advisories)
of the `warehouse-pg/whpg-diskquota` repository, together with any mitigating
steps users can take until the fix can be applied.

## Mailing lists

- Use analytics-security@enterprisedb.org to report security concerns to the
  WarehousePG project team, who uses the list to privately discuss security
  issues and fixes prior to disclosure.

## Confidentiality, integrity and availability

We consider vulnerabilities leading to the compromise of data confidentiality,
elevation of privilege, or integrity to be our highest priority concerns.
Availability, in particular in areas relating to DoS and resource exhaustion,
is also a serious security concern. The WarehousePG project team takes
all vulnerabilities, potential vulnerabilities, and suspected vulnerabilities
seriously and will investigate them in an urgent and expeditious manner.

The defaults of WarehousePG diskquota itself, such as its GUC defaults and the
privileges on the objects that `CREATE EXTENSION diskquota` creates, are in
scope for this policy; report problems with them as described above.

WarehousePG diskquota runs inside a WarehousePG cluster and relies on the
server's configuration. We do not currently consider the default settings for
WarehousePG to be secure-by-default: operators need to explicitly configure
settings, role based access control, and other resource related features to
provide a hardened environment. Issues that come from WarehousePG server
defaults rather than from WarehousePG diskquota itself are covered by the
[WarehousePG security policy](https://github.com/warehouse-pg/warehouse-pg/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
